🐔In this challenge I was asked to build a portfolio from scratch.

🐔I was told it had to be interactive and somewhat fit the animated mock-up.

🐔I started by writing a style reset sheet, and brainstorming a basic layout for
    my portfolio.

🐔I was able to get working Navigation links at the top of the page.

🐔I do not have much content to screenshot; so I used a stock-image of 
    some servers with buttons that highlight when you hover them.

🐔I do not know how to make buttons go anywhere.

🐔I tested the compatibility in several screen sizes to great success on 
    both large and small screens.

🐔I have created a fine template to add later content and projects on as I
    gain expertise; and other skills.

🐔There is a working email link; a link to my github, and several dummy buttons.

🐔I did not include a screenshot of any deployed applications within the portfolio
    because it was not aesthetically pleasing, and I have only built like two
    things.

🐔Below is a screenshot of my deployed portfolio:
